<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
color:#525252'>Thank you for visiting our web site. This web site belongs to
and is operated by Henkel Corporation or one of its subsidiary or affiliated
companies (&quot;Henkel&quot;).&nbsp; Henkel is committed to protecting and
safeguarding your privacy on the Internet. This Privacy Policy outlines the
information Henkel may be collecting from visitors and how we will use and
protect that information.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><strong><span style='font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
color:#525252'>By using our web site in any way, such as browsing or
interacting, you signify that you agree with the terms of our current Privacy
Policy as posted here.&nbsp; If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, you
should not use this web site. Henkel reserves the right to change or remove
this Privacy Policy at our discretion.&nbsp; We encourage you to visit this
area frequently to stay informed. To make this policy easy to find, we make it
available on our home page and at every point where personally identifiable
information may be requested.</span></p>

Collected</span></strong><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
color:#525252'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
color:#525252'>We collect two types of information about visitors:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
color:#525252'>Personally Identifiable Information: Personally identifiable
information is any information which can be used to identify an individual,
such as a name, address, telephone number, social security number, billing and
shipping information, credit card information or e-mail address. When you visit
our web site, we will not collect any personally identifiable information about
you unless you provide it to us voluntarily. You can visit our web sites
without telling us who you are or revealing personally identifiable information
about yourself, in which case you may however be unable to participate in
certain product promotions or receive product information. From time to time,
Henkel may offer sweepstakes, contests and surveys.&nbsp; Participation in
these promotions is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice
whether or not to disclose this information. In the event you wish to enter a
sweepstakes, contest or survey but do not wish us to maintain your personal
information for any purpose unrelated to the sweepstakes, contest or survey,
you may notify us, and provide a description of the specific sweepstakes,
contest or survey to: <a href="mailto:henkelprivacy@us.henkel.com"><span
style='color:#525252'>henkelprivacy@us.henkel.com</span></a>. If you otherwise
do not agree with any term in this Policy, please do not provide any personally
identifiable information on this site or participate in any Henkel surveys,
promotions, or other activities requiring this information. If you do submit
personally identifiable information, we may also combine that personally
identifiable information with other information collected, such as what areas
of our web site you visit and any downloads or transactions that you make from
our site.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
color:#525252'>Aggregate and Statistical Data: Henkel may collect certain
non-personally identifiable aggregate data called web log information (such as
your web browser, operating system, pages visited, etc.) and use cookies or web
beacons when you visit some of our web pages. For instance, when you visit one
of our web sites, our webserver will automatically recognize some non-personal
information, including but not limited to the date and time you visited our
site, the pages you visited, the referrer (the website you came from), the type
of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of
operating system you are using (e.g., Windows XP or Mac OS) and the domain name
and address of your internet server (e.g., AOL). We also may collect your
Internet Protocol (IP) address. An IP address is a number that is assigned to
your computer when you use the Internet. The IP address data that we collect
does not contain any personally identifiable information about you and is used
to administer our site, to determine the numbers of different visitors to the
site and to gather broad demographic data. We do not use cookies to retrieve
information that is unrelated to your visit to or your interaction with this
web site.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
color:#525252'>In some cases we may also collect information that you
voluntarily submit and which is anonymous, such as general statistical
information (e.g., age, gender, household size, zip/postal code, preferences or
interests). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
color:#525252'>How Information Is Collected:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
color:#525252'>Personally Identifiable Information: Henkel collects personally
identifiable information from our web site visitors only on a voluntary basis.
Such information may be collected from you if you choose to participate in the
following via our web site: web site registrations, contests, sweepstakes,
questionnaires, surveys, consumer service contacts, employment inquiries,
product purchases, or other similar activities requiring the submission of
personally identifiable information.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
color:#525252'>Aggregate and Statistical Data: Cookies and web beacons are used
to collect non-personal information automatically from visitors to our site. A
&quot;cookie&quot; is a small piece of data that can be sent by a webserver to
your computer, which then may be stored by your browser on your computer's hard
drive. Cookies help us in many ways to make your visit to our web site more
convenient and meaningful to you. For example, cookies allow us to tailor a web
site or advertisement to better match your interests and preferences, or to
save you the trouble of reentering certain information in some registration
areas. </span></p>
