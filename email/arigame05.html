              wrote the book on applying technology to advance the interests
              of clients. But when we came up with the idea of delivering news
              that clients need through Really Simple Syndication (RSS) “feeds,” our
              thinking was way outside the box – and outside our <em>own
              book!</em><br>
              <br>
              <strong>ARI <em>insights™</em></strong>, our intelligent web-based car and truck fleet management
            system, can put information clients request at their fingertips so
            they don’t have to do time-consuming searches.
            Through an abundant new library of ARI-syndicated feeds, we can supply
            world news, industry-specific white papers, or even the latest headlines
            from ARI. Why do we help clients stay current on events and trends
            taking shape around the world? <br>
            <br>
            The more knowledgeable you are as a fleet manager, the greater your
            contribution to your company. RSS feeds from <strong>ARI <em>insights</em></strong> take that extra step
            to give you <em>actionable</em> information that helps you make smart, informed
            fleet decisions.<br>
