              Updates are huge. We refer to their <em>benefits</em>, of course.</p>
            <p>The Bulk Update is a capability available through <strong>ARI <em>insights</em></strong>&#8482;, 
              our intelligent web-based car and truck fleet management system. 
              Rather than updating vehicles manually one by one, this new feature 
              makes it possible for ARI customers to query and update information 
              such as division, cost center, location, truck upfitting status, 
              etc., on <em>all vehicles in the listing automatically</em>. The 
              time this saves, the savings it generates, and the productivity 
              it produces &#8211; all are huge benefits to our clients.</p>
            <p>The technology, sophisticated and complex, is unique to ARI. But 
              our CIS developers mastered the challenge, which now enables fleet 
              managers not just to bulk-update vehicles but to do it in real-time 
              and handle multiple fields at once. Clients can even inform drivers 
              of the changes as they're happening, through Bulk E-mail. But that's 
              another <strong>ARI <em>insights</em></strong>&#8482; feature &#8211; and 
              the subject of next week's mailer.</p>
            <p>You have to be an ARI customer to get the use, value and advantage 
              of <strong>ARI <em>insights</em></strong>&#8482;, but you don't have to 
              be a customer to call <strong>1-800-477-4715</strong> for more information. 
              And you don't have to be a customer to enter our win-a-computer 
              contest above.</p>
