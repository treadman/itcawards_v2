              likes reports, but they're a fact
              of business life. Everybody gets them or gives them or both. On
              the receiving end, reports require you to read and make a decision
              or take some action. On the giving end, you collect, organize and
              try to present data in a way that makes the receiver's job
              easier. <br>
            <br>
            And that’s a real puzzler. How do you dress up dull gray paragraphs,
            tables, charts and graphs to create a quality report that helps receivers
            more easily spot opportunities to fix inefficiencies and save money?
