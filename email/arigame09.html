Bulk E-mail is exactly what it sounds like: the quickest and surest way a client
can reach a large group with a single message &ndash; and keep from getting bogged
down in re-creating the same message and e-mail over and over for each individual.
Now, for example, when an alert comes in confirming that certain drivers failed
to complete a required action such as scheduled maintenance, Bulk E-mail enables
the fleet manager to draft a single e-mail and expeditiously bulk-broadcast that
same message to all non-compliant drivers, thus updating everyone simultaneously
and saving valuable time.<br />
            <br />

Bulk E-mail is another compelling demonstration of how ARI is exploring and leveraging
technology to improve the productivity and efficiency of clients and their fleet
operations.<br />
