              in-session Alerts make it possible for ARI <br />
            customers to act quickly on time-sensitive events. That&rsquo;s because
            our clients have <strong>ARI <em>insights&#8482;</em></strong> doing
            some very important, behind-the-scenes work for them.<br />
            <br />
            ARI&rsquo;s intelligent web-based car and truck fleet management system
            continuously monitors the fleet database, watching in real-time for
            client-defined events and information updates. No matter when or
            where an event happens that requires attention, the system tells
            the client it&rsquo;s time to act by dispatching a popup screen Alert.
            The Alert even provides a link where the fleet manager can get the
            information necessary to take action or make a decision &ndash; without
            having to call anyone.<br />
            <br />
              Our innovative Alerts keep ARI customers ahead of the curve and 
              help ensure compliance and Best Practices are being maintained in 
              all areas of fleet operation. We built our new system on an SOA 
              (Service Oriented Architecture) that takes full advantage of the 
              latest technologies available today.<br />
            <br />
            Only from ARI. Call <strong>1-800-477-4715</strong> and find out
            how <strong>ARI <em>insights</em></strong>            can
            help you better manage those time-consuming, day-to-day events that
            really matter. ARI customers and soon-to-be customers are welcome
            to make the call. After you enter our contest to win a free computer,
            of course. <br />
